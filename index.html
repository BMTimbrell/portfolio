                            Hi, my name is Ben Timbrell. I enjoy problem solving, which has led me to an interest in
                            computer programming. 
                        </p>

                            I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Internet Computing from Aberystwyth University.
                            This website is a place for me to share information about my projects.
